# CourseWise-SEN3006
This project is a desktop GUI application designed to help university students make informed decisions during course selection periods.

Students can search for courses, view detailed information about the courses such as credits, rate courses based on their experiences and submit reviews.

The application will be developed using Java and JavaFX for the user interface, with PostgreSQL as the database.

This project aims to make the course selection process easier for students while also allowing them to gather more information about the courses.
